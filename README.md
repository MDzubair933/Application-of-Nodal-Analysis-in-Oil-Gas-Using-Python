# Application of Nodal Analysis in Oil Gas Using Python
Developed a sophisticated program to analyze well data, enabling the determination of optimal bottom hole pressure and flow rate. The program also visualizes Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) and Tubing Performance Relationship (TPR) curves, facilitating the identification of the wellâ€™s optimal operating point for improved production efficiency.
